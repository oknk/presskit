  Seaquence &mdash; Make living music!
  </p>

  <p>
  Seaquence is a unique musical sequencer environment that allows you to create soundscapes by layering collections of musical creatures. A spatialized mix emerges as only the closest creatures can be heard, resulting in a organic sonic experience that changes as you play. Visually immersive and sonically dynamic, Seaquence is a completely unique audiovisual composition environment. You've never seen (or heard) anything like it!
  </p>

  <p>
  Seaquence features a pro-level synthesizer and timing engine controlled by a fun and direct interface. Even composers who are brand new to synthesis will be able to unlock their synesthetic creativity!

  Seaquence is created by Okaynokay (Ryan Alexander + Gabriel Dunne), based on an original project created by Ryan Alexander, Gabriel Dunne, Daniel Massey, and Gray Area Foundation for the Arts. See the original project at <a href='http://seaquence.org'>seaquence.org</a>

history: "
  <p>
  In the spring of 2009 Ryan Alexander, Gabriel Dunne, and Daniel Massey participated in fledgling arts organization Gray Area’s first artist residency in the Tenderloin, the heart of San Francisco. While in residence they created the original <a href=\"http://seaquence.org\">seaquence.org</a> web app with support from the Gray Area team. Seaquence.org became a seminal project in Gray Area history that blossomed into a vibrant community and has accumulated well over 200,000 compositions and counting. It continues to be enjoyed by people around the world.
  </p>

  <p>
  Since then a lot has changed. Seaquence.org was originally written in Adobe Flash before the original iPad was released. Flash has slowly been phased out as an interactive platform on the web, and doesn't work at all on mobile devices.
  </p>

  <p>
  In mid-2014 Ryan and Gabe decided that the best way to keep the Seaquence community alive was to do what they had been talking about for years — bring the app to iPad. Over the next two and a half years, they built a new version of Seaquence from the ground up with a brand-new codebase, introducing shiny new graphics and a high quality sound engine, graduating Seaquence from a Flash web-toy to a fully-featured creative experience.

design: "The interface is bright, colorful and mostly devoid of text, encouraging exploration and an engaging interaction between audio and visual. A custom physics engine was developed which allows the creatures swimming motions to feel organic and playful. Each creature has a unique swimming movement that is derived from the notes in their individual sequencer tempo and pattern, represented by pulsing nodes in their antennae, and their tail is a graphical representation of their waveform.

  <br/><br/>

  The musical composition design approach is one that encourages exploration and education. By tying visual interface components to their synthesis counterparts, a composer who is unfamiliar with synthesizer or musical concepts are encouraged to experiment and create sounds freely. Creatures appear to swim under a microscope, both representing an exploration of the unseen and unknown, and a discovery of new sounds and tones. The online browser encourages users to browse what other people have made, and share their own creations. If a user starts a composition from an existing session, the family tree is maintained so you can always trace back up the tree to the parent session."
