description: "Seaquence is a synthesizer app that allows you to compose and explore dynamic musical soundscapes. Intricate and layered musical creations come to life with collections of organic swimming creatures, each with their own voice that contributes to a spatialized composition. Only the closest creatures can be heard, resulting in a sonic experience that evolves and changes as you listen!"

history: "Way back in 2009, Ryan Alexander, Gabriel Dunne, and Daniel Massey participated in SF arts organization Gray Areaâ€™s first Artist Residency program. While in residence they created the original Seaquence web app (http://seaquence.org). The project came from ideas around social music, audio/visual connections and sensibilities, alternative forms of composition music and experimentation. Since it was launched in 2010, the original version of Seaquence has resulted in a vibrant community that has shared well over 200,000 compositions."

design: "The interface is bright, colorful and mostly devoid of text, encouraging exploration and an engaging interaction between audio and visual. A custom physics engine was developed which allows the creatures swimming motions to feel organic and playful. Each creature has a unique swimming movement that is derived from the notes in their individual sequencer tempo and pattern, represented by pulsing nodes in their antennae, and their tail is a graphical representation of their waveform.

  <br/><br/>

  The musical composition design approach is one that encourages exploration and education. By tying visual interface components to their synthesis counterparts, a composer who is unfamiliar with synthesizer or musical concepts are encouraged to experiment and create sounds freely. Creatures appear to swim under a microscope, both representing an exploration of the unseen and unknown, and a discovery of new sounds and tones. The online browser encourages users to browse what other people have made, and share their own creations. If a user starts a composition from an existing session, the family tree is maintained so you can always trace back up the tree to the parent session."
